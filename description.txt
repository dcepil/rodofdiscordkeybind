A very simple and light-weight mod which lets you set a keybind/hotkey for your Rod of Discord/Rod of Harmony.
Requires a Rod of Discord/Harmony to be present in your inventory - the mechanics are unchanged - it just uses the item from your inventory.
You still have to stop attacking to trigger the Rod of Discord/Harmony - you cannot use it if you're mid attack/animation.

Inspired by Ilysen's RODHTDS and jopojelly's Helpful Hotkeys.

Changelog:
1.1
